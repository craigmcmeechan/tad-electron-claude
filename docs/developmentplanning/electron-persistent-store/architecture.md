# Electron Store Architecture

## Overview

The electron-store implementation for TAD provides a robust, cross-process persistent storage solution that ensures data consistency between the main Electron process and renderer processes. This document details the architectural design and implementation approach.

## Core Architecture Components

### 1. Store Manager (Main Process)

The Store Manager is the central component that manages the electron-store instance and coordinates data synchronization across processes.

**Key Responsibilities:**
- Initialize and configure electron-store
- Handle data validation and schema enforcement
- Manage change listeners and notifications
- Coordinate backup and recovery operations
- Provide IPC communication interface

**Architecture:**

│ • Data Sync     │    │ • File watching │
│ • Backup Mgmt   │    │ • Auto-reload   │

```

### 2. IPC Communication Layer

The IPC layer provides secure, typed communication between the main process and renderer processes.

**Features:**
- Secure API exposure via preload scripts
- Typed request/response handling
- Error propagation and recovery
- Change notification broadcasting
- Listener management and cleanup

### 3. Error Correction System

The Error Correction System provides robust data integrity and recovery capabilities through binary diffs, validation, and migration backups.

**Key Features:**
- Pre-flight data validation
- Binary diff creation for rollback
- Automatic error detection and recovery
- Timestamp-based history tracking
- Schema validation and sanitization
- Full backup creation for all migration operations

### 4. Renderer API

The renderer API provides a consistent, reactive interface for renderer processes to interact with stored data.

**Key Features:**
- Reactive data binding
- Automatic synchronization
- Type-safe operations
- Error handling and recovery
- Performance optimizations

## Data Flow Architecture

### Write Operation Flow

```
Renderer Process → IPC → Store Manager → Error Correction → electron-store → JSON File
     ↓              ↓         ↓              ↓              ↓            ↓
  Validation    Security   Schema Check   Pre-flight       Atomic Write   Disk
  & Sanitization Check     & Migration    Validation       & Backup       Sync
                                           ↓              & Diff Creation
                                     Binary Diff → storeHistory/
                                           ↓
                              Migration Backup → storeHistory/
                                   (for migration operations)
```

### Read Operation Flow

```
Renderer Process ← IPC ← Store Manager ← electron-store ← JSON File
     ↑              ↑         ↑              ↑            ↑
  Cache Update   Response   Data Retrieval  File Read    Disk
  & Reactivity   Handling   & Validation   & Parsing    Access
```

### Change Notification Flow

```
JSON File Change → electron-store → Store Manager → IPC Broadcast → Renderer Processes
     ↓                     ↓              ↓                  ↓
  File Watcher         Auto-reload     Event Emission    Cache Update
  (chokidar)           Detection       & Listener        & Re-render
                         ↓              Notification
                    Backup Creation   (if critical data)
```
