## Recommendation and Rationale

### **Primary Recommendation: Microsoft Rush Monorepo**

Given the complexity of the TAD Electron migration and the need for parallel development across multiple teams, I recommend **Microsoft Rush monorepo** as the optimal development strategy.

#### **Key Rationale:**

1. **Complexity Match**: The LSP server implementation complexity and multi-target build requirements align perfectly with Rush's capabilities for handling complex dependency chains.

2. **Team Structure**: With multiple teams working on interdependent components (Electron app, LSP server, UI components), Rush provides the best support for parallel development while maintaining code quality.

3. **Scalability**: Rush can scale to support the full development team (50+ developers) working simultaneously, which will be crucial as the project grows.

4. **Build Performance**: The phased build system and incremental builds will significantly improve development velocity compared to alternative approaches.

5. **Ecosystem Maturity**: Rush has proven scalability in large enterprise environments and provides the governance needed for consistent code quality.

### **Secondary Recommendation: Nx Monorepo**

If budget allows and the team has experience with advanced build tools, **Nx monorepo** would be a strong alternative. Nx provides superior build performance and developer experience but requires higher initial investment and has a steeper learning curve.

### **When to Consider Alternatives:**

- **Multi-Repository**: Only if teams are completely independent and coordination overhead can be minimized
- **Single Repository Enhanced**: Only for very small teams or if timeline constraints prevent monorepo adoption
