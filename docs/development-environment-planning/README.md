# Development Environment Planning

## Overview

This directory contains planning documents for establishing a robust development environment that supports parallel development across multiple teams and complex build processes. The focus is on creating a scalable, maintainable development infrastructure that can handle the complexity of migrating TAD from a VS Code extension to a standalone Electron application.

## Current Development Challenges

### 1. **Complex Build System**
- Multiple build targets (Electron main process, renderer process, LSP server)
- Cross-platform compilation requirements
- Webpack bundling for Node.js executables
- Integration between VS Code extension and Electron app

### 2. **Parallel Development Needs**
- Multiple teams working simultaneously on different components
- LSP server development (separate process architecture)
- UI/UX development (React components)
- Backend services (Node.js, file system operations)
- Testing infrastructure (unit, integration, E2E)

### 3. **Dependency Management**
- Complex dependency trees across multiple packages
- Version conflicts between VS Code extension and Electron dependencies
- Build tool dependencies (webpack, electron-builder, etc.)
- Development tool dependencies (testing frameworks, linting, etc.)

### 4. **Cross-Platform Development**
- Windows, macOS, and Linux development environments
- Consistent development experience across platforms
- Platform-specific build configurations
- Testing across multiple operating systems

### 5. **Electron GUI Development Constraints**
- **Container Limitations**: Electron GUI applications cannot run directly in dev containers
- **Display Server Requirements**: Built executables must run on host system
- **Hybrid Development Needs**: Balance between containerized development and local execution
- **Debugging Complexity**: Remote debugging requirements for GUI applications

## Proposed Solutions

### **Enhanced Monorepo Architecture: Microsoft Rush + GitHub Workspaces + Hybrid Electron Development**

Given the complexity of the TAD migration and the need for parallel development across multiple teams, I recommend establishing an enhanced monorepo architecture combining **Microsoft Rush** with **GitHub Workspaces** and a **hybrid Electron development workflow**. This approach addresses both the technical complexity of the monorepo and the unique challenges of Electron GUI application development:

#### **Benefits of Enhanced Rush + GitHub Workspaces + Hybrid Electron Development**
1. **Scalable Build System**: Rush's phased build system handles complex dependency chains efficiently
2. **Parallel Development**: Multiple teams can work on different packages simultaneously
3. **Consistent Tooling**: Standardized build, test, and lint scripts across all packages
4. **Dependency Management**: Rigorous dependency management prevents version conflicts
5. **Performance**: Incremental builds and caching improve development velocity
6. **Governance**: Centralized policy enforcement for code quality and security
7. **Cloud Development**: GitHub Workspaces provides instant, consistent development environments
8. **Rapid Onboarding**: New developers can start coding in minutes, not hours
9. **Cross-Platform Consistency**: Identical experience across Windows, macOS, and Linux
10. **Enhanced Collaboration**: Real-time collaborative coding and debugging
11. **Hybrid Electron Workflow**: Optimal balance between containerized development and local GUI testing
12. **Electron-Specific Optimization**: Purpose-built configurations for Electron application development

- **Documentation**: Centralized documentation system

## Risk Mitigation

### **Migration Risks**
- **Learning Curve**: Rush has a learning curve for development teams
- **Initial Setup Complexity**: Monorepo setup requires careful planning
- **Tooling Changes**: Teams need to adapt to new development workflows

### **Mitigation Strategies**
- **Phased Migration**: Gradual migration to minimize disruption
- **Training Program**: Comprehensive training for all developers
- **Support Structure**: Dedicated support during transition period
- **Fallback Plans**: Ability to rollback if issues arise

## Next Steps

1. **Evaluate Current Complexity**: Assess if current project complexity justifies monorepo approach
2. **Stakeholder Alignment**: Get buy-in from development teams and management
3. **Pilot Implementation**: Start with a small subset of packages
4. **Success Metrics**: Define clear success criteria for the migration
5. **Timeline Planning**: Create detailed timeline for monorepo implementation

## Alternative Approaches

### **Option 1: Stay with Single Repository**
- Continue with current structure
- Use better tooling within existing setup
- Implement improved build scripts

### **Option 2: Multi-Repository Approach**
- Separate repositories for major components
- Use Git submodules for shared code
- Implement cross-repository tooling

### **Option 3: Hybrid Approach**
- Keep main application in single repo
- Extract only high-complexity components (LSP server)
- Maintain simpler structure for core application
