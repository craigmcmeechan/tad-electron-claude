# Phase 7: Performance Optimization (Weeks 17-18)

## Overview

Phase 7 focuses on optimizing the performance of the Electron application, addressing memory usage, startup times, and rendering performance to ensure a smooth user experience.

## Objectives

- Analyze and optimize application performance
- Reduce memory usage and improve startup times
- Optimize rendering and UI responsiveness
- Implement caching and lazy loading strategies
- Establish performance monitoring and benchmarking

## Timeline
