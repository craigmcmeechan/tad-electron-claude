# Phase 5: Security Implementation (Weeks 12-13)

## Overview

Phase 5 focuses on implementing comprehensive security measures for the Electron application, replacing VS Code's extension security model with Electron-specific security practices.

## Objectives

- Implement comprehensive security framework
- Setup secure IPC communication patterns
- Create file system security validation
- Establish content security policies
- Implement security monitoring and logging

## Timeline
**Duration:** 2 weeks (Weeks 12-13)
**Team:** Security Engineer (lead), Backend Developer
**Dependencies:** Phase 4 completion

## Key Deliverables

### Security Infrastructure
- [ ] FileSecurityManager for path validation and access control with comprehensive logging
- [ ] CommandSecurityManager for safe command execution with audit trails
- [ ] NetworkSecurityManager for request filtering with security event logging
- [ ] CSP generation and enforcement with violation logging
- [ ] Security logging and monitoring system with real-time alerts
- [ ] Security metrics collection and reporting
- [ ] Security incident response and escalation procedures
- [ ] Security audit trail for compliance and forensics
- [ ] Store security validation and encryption for sensitive data
- [ ] Store access control and permission management
- [ ] Store security event logging and monitoring
- [ ] Store data sanitization and input validation
- [ ] Store security backup and recovery mechanisms

### IPC Security
- [ ] Secure preload script implementation with security logging
- [ ] IPC message validation and sanitization with audit trails
- [ ] Context isolation verification with violation logging
- [ ] Secure API exposure patterns with access logging
- [ ] IPC security metrics collection and monitoring
- [ ] IPC message encryption for sensitive data
- [ ] IPC rate limiting and abuse detection

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All security managers functional and tested
- [ ] IPC communication is secure and validated
- [ ] File system access properly restricted
- [ ] Security events logged and monitored
- [ ] No critical security vulnerabilities
- [ ] Security logging captures all security-relevant events
- [ ] Security metrics provide real-time monitoring capabilities
- [ ] Security audit trails enable compliance and forensics
- [ ] Security alerts trigger appropriate responses
- [ ] Store data is properly encrypted for sensitive information
- [ ] Store access control prevents unauthorized data access
- [ ] Store security events are logged and monitored
- [ ] Store data sanitization prevents malicious input
- [ ] Store security backups protect against data loss
