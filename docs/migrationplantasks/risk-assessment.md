# Migration Risk Assessment

## Overview

This document identifies, analyzes, and provides mitigation strategies for risks associated with migrating TAD from a VS Code extension to a standalone Electron application.

## Risk Categories and Assessment

### 1. Technical Risks

#### Risk: VS Code API Dependencies
**Probability:** High
**Impact:** Critical
**Status:** Mitigated

**Description:**
The current extension heavily relies on VS Code APIs for:
- Webview management (`vscode.WebviewPanel`, `vscode.WebviewView`)
- File system operations (`vscode.workspace.fs`)
- Language server integration (`vscode.languages.*`)
- Configuration management (`vscode.workspace.getConfiguration`)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- [ ] Comprehensive API mapping completed (see vscode-dependencies-migration.md)
- [ ] Electron equivalents identified for all major APIs
- [ ] Fallback mechanisms implemented
- [ ] Gradual migration approach with feature flags

**Contingency Plans:**
- Maintain VS Code extension as fallback during transition
- Implement feature flags to disable problematic features
- Prepare rollback procedures for critical components

#### Risk: Performance Degradation
**Probability:** Medium
**Impact:** High
**Status:** Monitored

**Description:**
Electron applications typically have higher memory usage and slower startup times compared to VS Code extensions.

**Current Metrics (VS Code Extension):**
- Startup time: < 2 seconds
- Memory usage: < 100MB
- CPU usage: Minimal when inactive

**Projected Metrics (Electron App):**
- Startup time: 3-5 seconds (target)
- Memory usage: 150-250MB (target)
- CPU usage: Higher baseline due to Node.js process

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- [ ] Implement performance monitoring from day one
- [ ] Use lazy loading for non-critical components
- [ ] Optimize bundle size and loading strategies
- [ ] Implement caching for frequently accessed data

**Contingency Plans:**
- Performance budgets with automatic alerts
- Code splitting to reduce initial bundle size
- Progressive loading of features

#### Risk: LSP Server Implementation Complexity
**Probability:** High
**Impact:** Critical
