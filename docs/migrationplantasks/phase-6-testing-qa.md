# Phase 6: Testing and Quality Assurance (Weeks 14-16)

## Overview

Phase 6 establishes comprehensive testing infrastructure and quality assurance processes for the Electron application, ensuring reliability and performance meet production standards.

## Objectives

- Setup comprehensive testing framework
- Implement automated testing pipelines
- Create performance benchmarking
- Establish quality assurance processes
- Validate cross-platform compatibility

## Timeline
**Duration:** 3 weeks (Weeks 14-16)
**Team:** QA Engineer (lead), DevOps Engineer
**Dependencies:** Phase 5 completion
